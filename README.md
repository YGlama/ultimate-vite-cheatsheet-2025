## Introduction

Vite is a modern build tool that provides a fast development experience. It supports hot module replacement (HMR), which allows developers to see changes instantly. This cheatsheet covers everything you need to know about Vite in 2025, including setup, configuration, optimization, and deployment strategies.

## Setup

Setting up Vite is straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a New Project**:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-vite-app
   cd my-vite-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This command starts the development server, and you can view your application in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

Vite uses a configuration file called `vite.config.js`. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  base: './',
  plugins: [],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
    open: true,
  },
});
```

### Important Configuration Options

- **base**: The base public path for the application.
- **plugins**: An array of Vite plugins for extended functionality.
- **server**: Server options such as port and whether to open the browser automatically.

## Optimization

Optimizing your Vite application can greatly enhance performance. Here are some key strategies:

1. **Code Splitting**: Vite automatically splits your code into smaller chunks. You can further optimize this by using dynamic imports.

2. **Tree Shaking**: Ensure you are using ES modules to take advantage of tree shaking, which removes unused code.

3. **Preload and Prefetch**: Use `<link rel="preload">` and `<link rel="prefetch">` in your HTML to load resources efficiently.

4. **Analyze Your Bundle**: Use tools like `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to analyze your bundle size and find areas for improvement.

## Deployment

Deploying your Vite application is simple. You can use platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. Hereâ€™s a basic guide for deploying to GitHub Pages:

1. **Build Your Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   Use the `gh-pages` package to deploy your build folder:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

   Then add the following script to your `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"
   }
   ```

   Finally, run:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Best Practices

To make the most of Vite, consider the following best practices:

- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your dependencies to benefit from performance improvements and security fixes.

- **Use Environment Variables**: Manage different configurations for development and production using environment variables.

- **Leverage Vite Plugins**: Explore the Vite plugin ecosystem to enhance your development experience.

- **Document Your Code**: Maintain clear documentation for your project to help others understand your work.

## Supported Frameworks

Vite works seamlessly with various frameworks, including:

- **React**: Easily integrate Vite with React projects.
- **Vue**: Leverage Viteâ€™s features for Vue applications.
- **Svelte**: Use Vite for fast Svelte development.
- **TypeScript**: Vite has built-in support for TypeScript.
